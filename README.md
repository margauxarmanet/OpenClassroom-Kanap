Check-out my work in : front > js

This is a school project that gave me the oportunity to learn the following technical points : 
- the use of the API (GET, POST);
- the DOM (adding, deleting and modifying elements);
- the use of URLSearchParams;
- using localStorage.

The only thing I can use is Javascript and I am not allowed to modify any of the files given to me. 

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
